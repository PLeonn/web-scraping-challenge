Ensure the correct chromedriver is installed and located in web-scraping-challenge/.

Check that MongoDB is downloaded and working by opening a terminal and entering 'mongod'.

Open another terminal and enter 'mongo', then check your current databases by entering 'show dbs'. You should be looking for mars_app in your databases.

Open a browser to the page listed in the terminal/click on the command-prompt-generated link (should be http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
